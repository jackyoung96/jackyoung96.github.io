<h2 class="yearbar"> 2022 </h2>

### Snake game with preference-based reinforcement learning (Jan. 2022 - Feb. 2022)

- Do It Yourself AI (DIYA), KC-ML2
- Role - Deep learning engineer

<h2 class="yearbar"> 2021 </h2>

### Jumple (Jan. 2021 - Current)

- Autonomous Robot Intelligence Lab (ARIL), SNU
- Role - Deep learning engineer

This is an educational program to help children exercise in a pandemic situation. Pose estimation is conducted through the PoseNet and multiple games were designed for encouraging students to exercise.

<h2 class="yearbar"> 2020 </h2>

### Autonomous Golf Car (Jun. 2020 - Jul. 2021)

- Autonomous Robot Intelligence Lab (ARIL), SNU
- Role - Project leader, hardware re-factoring, motion planning and control

This is the project that re-factorizing a golf car to be able to autonomously drive. The steering wheel was controlled by an additional DC motor and the gas pedal was controlled by Arduino with hijacking motor signal. Multiple sensors (16-channels LiDAR, stereo cameras, IMU, GPU, and wheel encoders) were mounted in proper position. All systems were connected using ROS in the main computer (Jetson Xavier)

### Autonomous Parking with RRT in Unity3D (Jan. 2020 - Mar. 2020)

- Autonomous Robot Intelligence Lab (ARIL), SNU

Motion planning by RRT* algorithm and Dubins path, and control by pure pursuit algorithm. This is my first project in the autonomous vehicle field and ARIL.

<h2 class="yearbar"> 2019 </h2>

### Autonomous Emergency Braking for Bicycle (Sep. 2019 - Dec. 2019)

- Mechatronics, SNU MAE
- Role - Project leader, deep learning engineer, re-factorizing hardware

This is a kind of driving assistance systems for bicycles. It detects the person in front by Yolo-v3 and gives differential warnings according to the distance. In case of hazardous situation, the automatic brake is operated.

### Stair Climbing Robot (Mar. 2019 - June 2019)

- Mechanical Product Design, SNU MAE
- Role - Mechanical engineer, 3D modeling, dynamics analysis

This is the project that Re-factorizing a segway to be able to climb stair. The optimal caterpillar structure was found through 3D modeling and dynamics analysis.
