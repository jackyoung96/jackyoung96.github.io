<h2 class="yearbar"> 2022 </h2>

### International research internship (Human Resource Development Program for Industrial Innovation)

- University of Maryland, Motion and teaming lab (Dr. Machael Wilson Otte)
- Fully funded by Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology(KIAT) grant funded by the Korea Government(MOTIE)

### Snake game with preference-based reinforcement learning (Jan. 2022 - Feb. 2022)

- Do It Yourself AI (DIYA), KC-ML2
- Role - Simulator debugging, RL algorithms (QMIX, PbRL) implementation


<h2 class="yearbar"> 2021 </h2>

### Jumple (Jan. 2021 - Current)

- Autonomous Robot Intelligence Lab (ARIL), SNU
- Role - Deep learning engineer

This is an educational program to help children exercise in a pandemic situation. Pose estimation is conducted through the PoseNet and multiple games were designed for encouraging students to exercise.

<h2 class="yearbar"> 2020 </h2>

### Autonomous Golf Car (Jun. 2020 - Jul. 2021)

- Autonomous Robot Intelligence Lab (ARIL), SNU
- Role - Project leader, hardware re-factoring, motion planning and control

This is the project that re-factorizing a golf car to be able to autonomously drive. The steering wheel was controlled by an additional DC motor and the gas pedal was controlled by Arduino with hijacking motor signal. Multiple sensors (16-channels LiDAR, stereo cameras, IMU, GPU, and wheel encoders) were mounted in proper position. All systems were connected using ROS in the main computer (Jetson Xavier)

<h2 class="yearbar"> 2019 </h2>

### Human following control of holonomic robot based on vision recognition (Sep. 2019 - Aug. 2020)

- Undergraduate graduation thesis, SNU MAE
- Role - Robot design & manufacture, deep learning engineer

This is the graduation thesis project for Mechanical engineering departmen, Seoul National University. I designed a holonomic mobile robot by mechanum wheels that operated by ROS. OpenCV library was used to recognize a human size and to estimate distance from the robot.
